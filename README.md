# Mahjong Hand Builder
 
My attempt to create a mahjong hand builder to easily select tiles to display a certain hand. It currently works in the most rudimentary way.

Aug. 13: I now have everything centered with a fixed width. There is a box for where the selected tiles show up and a box for the final hand, although that currently contains nothing.

Aug. 14: I've limited the number of times each tile can be clicked to 4.

Next steps: open melds, kans, limit hand, reorganize hand, drawn tile

# Mahjong Hand Builder
 
My attempt to create a mahjong hand builder to easily select tiles to display a certain hand. It currently works in the most rudimentary way.

Aug. 13: I now have everything centered with a fixed width. There is a box for where the selected tiles show up and a box for the final hand, although that currently contains nothing.

Aug. 14: I've limited the number of times each tile can be clicked to 4.

Aug. 28: A warning will show up if there are fewer than 14 tiles selected.

Sep. 4: The reorganize hand button now will take the tiles that appear under "Selected Tiles" and reorganize them into the proper order.

Next steps: open melds, kans, limit hand, drawn tile
